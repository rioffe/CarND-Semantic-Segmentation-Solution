DONE 1. add command line parameters for epochs, batch size, learning rate and beta (regularization parameter)
DONE 2. collect and plot loss data
DONE 3. animation gif as a summary? convert -delay 30 -loop 0 *.png animation.gif

Good parameters:

Epochs: 30, Learning Rate: 0.001, Batch Size: 5, Beta 0.003- this one obtained w/ TensorFlow 1.2 running in AWS 
Epochs: 50, Learning Rate: 0.0001, Batch Size: 5, Beta 0.003 - this one obtained w/ TensorFlow 1.5 running on my local machine GT1060 card

Things to try: batch size of 16 (epochs 90 or more), lr .001, .0001
batch size of 20 (epochs 120 or more), lr .001, .0001
SGD?
